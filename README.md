## Android: Revolut Task
This is a very simple and straight-forward implementation of a Currency Converter using [Retrofit][1] and [RXAndroid][2] for the API requests and bindings.

### Disclaimer

This repository contains a sample code intended to demonstrate how to handle HTTP request to the Revolut API using using [Retrofit][1] and [RXAndroid][2]. We extracted the currency flags form [FlagKit][3]. The current version is not intended to be used as-is in applications as a library dependency, and will not be maintained as such. Bug fix contributions are welcome, but issues and feature requests will not be addressed.

### Pre-requisites

- Android SDK 28
- Java SDK 1.8
- Android Support Repository

## Credits

This project was based on these libraries:

- [Retrofit][1] A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [RXAndroid][2] Reactive Extensions for Android.
- [FlagKit][3] Beautiful flag icons for usage in apps and on the web.
